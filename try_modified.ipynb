    "# Constitution of India - Summarization & Risk-classification Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "What this notebook does (step-by-step)\n",
    "1. Loads your Constitution JSON (you said you already have it) and flattens the nested structure into rows (Articles / Clauses).\n",
    "2. Preprocesses text and creates pseudo-summaries (for quick prototyping). For best results you should supply human-written summaries.\n",
    "3. Generates a heuristic 'risk' label (0 = low, 1 = high) using keywords. Replace with manual labels if available.\n",
    "4. Prepares Hugging Face `datasets` objects and tokenizers.\n",
    "5. Fine-tunes:\n",
    "   - A T5 model for text simplification/summarization (seq2seq).\n",
    "   - A DistilBERT classifier for risk prediction (sequence classification).\n",
    "6. Provides inference utilities that accept PDF input (text or scanned) and run summarization + risk classification.\n",
    "7. Final cell triggers training (optional - uncomment to run).\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: This notebook contains prototype code. Training transformer models requires GPU and time. Adjust hyperparameters for your machine.\n"

    "- If `pdf2image.convert_from_path` raises an error on Windows, install Poppler and pass `poppler_path='C:/path/to/poppler/bin'` to the conversion function.\n",

    "- The hidden risk detector is a keyword-based heuristic. For production use, consider an ML classifier or rule engine.\n"
